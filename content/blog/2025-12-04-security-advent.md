On the fourth cyber-mas day my true love gave to me: a clean file-tree
an antivirus scan, a
key rotation and a
clean cache with no more cooooooo-kiiiiiiiiiiiiiies

## Your Home Directory

Most people have a disorganized home directory, some even brag about it.
Unfortunately, keeping a disorganized home directory is like keeping a dirty
bedroom: if you don't know what's there, you don't know how the bugs got in.

Tidying up is part of security just like making sure you don't click on
suspicious links in emails. If you know what you have on your computer, then
you can probably identify where a bug or exploit got introduced and _quickly_
remediate it. Now, for those who aren't inextricably linked to their computer
(first off, congratulations), this might seem like a pointless exercise.
However, you can do two things:
1. Clean up your recycle bin
2. Clear out your downloads folder

I suggest this not so much for security reasons, but more so that you have
an easy time seeing what you have on your drives.

I also woke up late today and did not have as much time as the other days to
write this.
