On the sixth cyber-mas day my true love gave to me: spam-filtered mail
a Password Man-a-geeeer
a clean file-tree
an antivirus scan, a
key rotation and a
clean cache with no more cooooooo-kiiiiiiiiiiiiiies

## Spam Filters

Most people already use a mail service with builtin spam filters, but in case
you don't, this is a reminder to get one.

Spam filters attempt to close a vector of attack, which is human fallibility.
In general, our technology is not the most vulnerable part of an organization,
rather it is the people inside that organization. We do not have the constant
vigilance a well built software system does; we as humans have lapses, we are
inconsistent and sometimes we have stupid moments.

Email phishing scams exploit those momentary lapses and inconsistencies through
social engineering, link clicking or other tools. If you have a spam filter,
then you are already protected against most spam campaigns.
