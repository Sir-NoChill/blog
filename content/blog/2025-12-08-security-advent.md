On the seventh cyber-mas day my true love gave to me: ad blocking software,
virtual machines,
spam-filtered mail,
a Password Man-a-geeeer,
a clean file-tree,
an antivirus scan, a
key rotation and a
clean cache with no more cooooooo-kiiiiiiiiiiiiiies

## How Ad Blockers Contribute to Security

Ever accidentally clicked on one of those aggressive advertisements while
scrolling your favorite news site? Yeah. Could get you hacked.

Unfortunately, more and more scam organizations are turning to
[AI generated ads](https://web.archive.org/web/20251208034654/https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/fake-ai-generated-ads-social-media/)
as an attack vector. Each of these ads can correspond to a malicious download,
a credential/telemetry bot or some other attack on your digital sovereignity.
Ad-Blockers help mitigate these issues, and despite the current [crackdown on
ad-blockers](https://web.archive.org/web/20251208035045/https://www.tomshardware.com/software/youtube-is-expanding-its-ad-blocking-powers-closes-loopholes-that-allowed-some-users-to-bypass-restrictions)
there are still good ways to protect yourself.

## Ad-Blocker Options

Depending on your level of technical savvy, you have a couple options:
1. [**UBlock-Origin**](https://ublockorigin.com): This is a free and open-source
   plugin for chromium-based
   browsers. It has a proven track record and the development process is
   very transparent.
2. [**PiHole**](https://pi-hole.net): A DNS-based solution for your home network
   because you _can_ just block traffic from _**all**_ of the ad providers

There are similar solutions for firefox and safari I am sure, but I do not have
experience with them.
